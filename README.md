## netflix_share
When you share your family account of Netflix with your friends, you will have some warnings to fix the true home.
You need to fix your netflix account with an email or by an sms to the owner of the account. Sometimes it's not you.
To bypass this warning, you need to share your netflix email with your friend. But it's boring.
You need to go to the email box, click on the message, open the link, then click on the netflix button.

I have done this script, to click on a link to automatize this workflow.

## Installation
Install a web server with php and imap extension.
Configure index.php with your email user / password.
$user = '';
$pass = ''; 

When you have the netflix warning, open the website, then click on the netflix button.
